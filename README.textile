*Simple Textile* is a small "WordPress":http://wordpress.org plugin for writing posts and pages in "Textile":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language).

h2. Installation & Usage

You can install Simple Textile by either uploading the plugin in a directory to @wp-content/plugins@, or by downloading it through the WordPress admin dashboard. In order to have a post or page processed in Textile, tick the "Process this post using Textile" checkbox below the editor.

(This adds a new custom field called "textile" to the entry. If an entry has the "textile" field filled with any text, it will be parsed as Textile instead of HTML.)

If you want to write all your posts using Textile, you might want to disable the visual editor from your user's preferences page.
